# Python Quiz Game

A simple **Python-based multiple-choice quiz game**. This project was inspired by **Jenny's Python lectures**, and I have added additional functionalities and questions to make it more interactive and complete.

## Features

- 20 multiple-choice questions covering Python basics and OOP concepts.
- Score tracking after each question.
- Immediate feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
- Displays the correct answer if the user selects the wrong option.
- Final score percentage displayed at the end.
- Fully self-contained Python script (no external modules required).

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).  
2. Download or clone the repository.  
3. Run the Python file:

```bash
python quiz_game.py
